<h1>Petra</h1>
<p>
    Inhabited since prehistoric times, this<b>Nabataean</b>  caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea and the <b>Dead Sea</b>, 
    was an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia. Petra is half-built, 
    half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded by mountains riddled with passages and gorges.
     It is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites,
      where ancient <b>Eastern</b> traditions blend with <b>Hellenistic</b> architecture.
